\begin{parts}
\part  (T) The virtual memory system, via page table-based address translation mechanisms, enables multiple processes to securely share identical physical memory regions (e.g., shared code libraries) while maintaining isolation.

\part  (F) A page-table walker (PTW) handles and resolves page faults by loading missing pages into memory.

\part  (F) The size of the virtual address space accessible to the program cannot be larger than
 the size of the physical address space.
 
\part  (F) Multi-level page tables optimize memory usage by storing complete physical addresses at the leaf level, enabling direct memory access without translation overhead.

\part  (F) When a page fault occurs, the operating system must evict a resident page before loading the requested page into memory.
